// Crashes in the fastest possible way with no attempt at logging.
// There are several constraints; see http://crbug.com/664209 for more context.
//
// - TRAP_SEQUENCE_() must be fatal. It should not be possible to ignore the
//   resulting exception or simply hit 'continue' to skip over it in a debugger.
// - Different instances of TRAP_SEQUENCE_() must not be folded together, to
//   ensure crash reports are debuggable. Unlike __builtin_trap(), asm volatile
//   blocks will not be folded together.
//   Note: TRAP_SEQUENCE_() previously required an instruction with a unique
//   nonce since unlike clang, GCC folds together identical asm volatile
//   blocks.
// - TRAP_SEQUENCE_() must produce a signal that is distinct from an invalid
//   memory access.
// - TRAP_SEQUENCE_() must be treated as a set of noreturn instructions.
//   __builtin_unreachable() is used to provide that hint here. clang also uses
//   this as a heuristic to pack the instructions in the function epilogue to
//   improve code density.
//
// Additional properties that are nice to have:
// - TRAP_SEQUENCE_() should be as compact as possible.
// - The first instruction of TRAP_SEQUENCE_() should not change, to avoid
//   shifting crash reporting clusters. As a consequence of this, explicit
//   assembly is preferred over intrinsics.
//   Note: this last bullet point may no longer be true, and may be removed in
//   the future.

// Note: TRAP_SEQUENCE Is currently split into two macro helpers due to the fact
// that clang emits an actual instruction for __builtin_unreachable() on certain
// platforms (see https://crbug.com/958675). In addition, the int3/bkpt/brk will
// be removed in followups, so splitting it up like this now makes it easy to
// land the followups.

// CHECK() and the trap sequence can be invoked from a constexpr function.
// This could make compilation fail on GCC, as it forbids directly using inline
// asm inside a constexpr function. However, it allows calling a lambda
// expression including the same asm.
// The side effect is that the top of the stacktrace will not point to the
// calling function, but to this anonymous lambda. This is still useful as the
// full name of the lambda will typically include the name of the function that
// calls CHECK() and the debugger will still break at the right line of code.
